# TOKENIZATION LLC - Mint/Own/Manage a Delaware LLC on ENS

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC
</br>
[`tokenizationllc.eth`](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)

### BACKGROUND:

> I think everyone with a self-custody wallet has the same problem, unmitigated legal risk and potential personal liabilities.

I have been a practicing attorney since 2010. The majority of my career I have acted as outside counsel for business organizations for mattets like governance, compliance, intellectual property protection, tax strategy, mergers & acquisitions, or other business transactions. 

In 2022 I launched an ENS project with a group of 4 that I had never met IRL. One claimed to be an attorney from the US (me); one claimed to be an astrophysicist+mathematician; one claimed to be an Australian photographer and surfer; and the last was totally undoxxed, but rumors abound of a Sherpa. I proposed the team set up a legal entity, something akin to the Cayman Island ENS Foundation, for purposes of limited liability protections and "legal personhood."  Not having limited liability protections was not acceptable to me, and understandably a legal entity wasn't acceptable to the team as a whole. My solution was PUNKS LLC, a Delaware Series LLC, and drafting legal, or governance, documentation memorializing 0x addresses and enspunks.eth subdomains as seperate protected series under PUNKS LLC.   

PUNKS LLC was a solution to a problem I had, but I think everyone with a self-custody wallet has the same problem, unmitigated legal risk and potential personal liabilities.  PUNKS LLC also saved me ~$200 per LLC (or wallet/ENS I wrapped) in filing fees, ~$50/year/LLC registered agent fee, and $300/yr/LLC franchise tax. 

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC? 

TOKENIZATION LLC is a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company. 

### üîÆ LLC ORACLE

The LLC Oracle is a composable legal, or governance, framework that validates TOKENIZATION LLC "proof of legal personhood" with Delaware Secretary of State - Division of Corporations public records and binds the protected series under TOKENIZATION LLC to ENS Names.

TOKENIZATION LLC tokenizationllc.eth subdomains will be the first subdomains

### WHY HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY?

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Documents and generally applicable as to why everyone would want a legal entity providing protections and benefits, otherwise please visit the TOKENIZATION LLC website for more information:

### TAXATION

The initial iteration of the LLC Oracle shall be restricted to authorizing "single-member" LLCs, or series, which are treated as a "disregarded entity" by default by the IRS and does not file a tax return.

### USE CASES:

<b>Limited Liability Protections:</b>

Just as an example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be joint and severely liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory that a DAO without a legal entity, or "legal wrapper", creates a General Partnership and members of the DAO are all considered General Partners.[2]  This particular case involved an alleged exploit and loss of ~$50M by a DeFi exchange. The plaintiffs sued the DAO and the members of the DAO.   This means that potentially a $50M judgment could be collectible against members of the DAO and their personal assets.  An LLC wrapping the wallet(s) hodling governance tokens and governance activities, including voting, can protect the owner and the owner's personal assets from those governance activities.

<b>RR-BAYC</b> 

An NFT project that did not use a legal entity "wrapper" to protect the individuals involved. Whatever your opinion about the case or the parties, the defendants were sued by Yuga Labs *individually* for approximately $2M in profits from alleged trademark infringement. Yuga ended up with a judgement that exceeded the alleged revenues of the project by $7M, because there was no legal entity protecting them, Yuga can pursue that $7M deficiency against the defendants personally, where an LLC might have limited their liability to the $2M in profits and investment in the NFT project.

<b>Bridge IRL Businesses Onchain:</b>

Businesses are more acutely aware of legal and regulatory considerations of accepting cryptocurrency and owning self-custodied digital assets. TOKENIZATION LLC can provide real world businesses a legal bridge onchain imported into ENS to manage the business wallets and other digital assets.   

<b>Legal Personhood and Right to Contract:</b>

Assume you own a NFT with commercial IP rights. A legal entity gives you a legal vehicle to own the NFT and enter into a real world legal agreements, such as a licensing agreement, of behalf of the NFT. The LLC protects the owner and the owners personal assets from potential liabilities of the licensing agreement.

<b>RWA Tokenization Abstraction:</b>

There are legal and regulatory issues preventing tokenization of certain real world assets. For example, a property owner would not generally be able to tokenize and transfer their property onchain in the US.  The US is a patchwork of laws with 50 states and thousands of counties that nearly all have their own rules regarding memorializing transfers of property by recording a public deed. While the direct ownership of property generally cannot be tokenized directly, an LLC can be created to own the property, recorded on a deed, and then the LLC ownership can be tokenized and transfered onchain without triggering a change in legal title of the property.
