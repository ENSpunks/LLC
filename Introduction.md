# TOKENIZATION LLC - Mint/Own/Manage a Delaware LLC on ENS

##

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC
</br>
[`tokenizationllc.eth`](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)

### BACKGROUND

I have been a practicing attorney since 2010. The majority of my career I have acted as outside counsel for business organizations. My practice included governance, compliance, intellectual property protection, tax strategy, mergers & acquisitions, or other business transactions.

In 2022 I launched an ENS project with a group of 4 that I had never met IRL. One claimed to be an attorney from the US (me); one claimed to be an astrophysicist+mathematician; one claimed to be an Australian photographer and surfer; and the last was totally undoxxed, but rumors abound of a Sherpa. I proposed the team set up a legal entity, something akin to the Cayman Island ENS Foundation, for purposes of limited liability protections and "legal personhood."  Not having limited liability protections was not acceptable to me, and understandably a legal entity wasn't acceptable to the team as a whole. My solution was PUNKS LLC, a Delaware Series LLC, and drafting legal, or governance, documentation memorializing 0x addresses and enspunks.eth subdomains as seperate protected series under PUNKS LLC.   

PUNKS LLC was a solution to a problem I had, but I think everyone with a self-custody wallet has the same problem, unmitigated legal risk and potential personal liabilities.  PUNKS LLC also saved me ~$200 per LLC (or wallet/ENS I wrapped) in filing fees, ~$50/year/LLC registered agent fee, and $300/yr/LLC franchise tax.  

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC? 

TOKENIZATION LLC, is a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company for minting/owning/managing "protected series" (seperate limited liability companies under TOKENIZATION LLC).

Where an ENS can create any number of subdomains, each with its own owner, manager, addresses, assets and records, a Series LLC can create any number of series, or seperate LLCs, each with its own owner, manager, accounts, assets, records, and limited liability protections. Further, where ENS has an owner and manager and the owner can change the manager, each series has a owner (called member) and manager, similarly the series owner can "set" the manager. Also where ENS names can be wrapped or unwrapped, a Delaware Series LLC series can be registered (filed woth the State) or protected (not filed with the State).

The LLC Oracle, describe below, is similar to DNSSEC for gasless DNS import into ENS. Mostly invisible infrastructure that when enabled provides an independent source of verification, or in the case of LLCs "proof of legal personhood."  

### üîÆ LLC ORACLE

The LLC Oracle is a legal framework that legally binds protected series under TOKENIZATION LLC to ENS names, subdomains, and subnames.

The initial LLC Oracle is currently made up of the following legal documentation:

üìú TOKENIZATION LLC Delaware Certificate of Formation (Filed)

üìÑ TOKENIZATION LLC Operating Agreement (Drafted, unpublished)

üìù [subdomain].tokenizationllc.eth Protected Series Operating Agreement (Drafted, unpublished)

‚öñÔ∏è Delaware LLC Act

### WHY HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY?

The rationale for limited liability protections for ENS DAO members is generally applicable to all web3 users, or anyone generally with one or more self-custody wallets that desires to take steps to legally protect their personal assets from onchain activities, assets and/or transactions.

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Document:


### TAXATION

Under the Cayman Island Foundation Company Law foundations, including the ENS Foundation, do not file or pay taxes.

LLCs have significantly more flexibility in their tax treatment. Therefore, at least initally the LLC Oracle will initially only authorize "single-member" LLCs to be formed as series under TOKENIZATION LLC. For tax purposes, the IRS treats a single-member LLC as a "disregarded entity" by default. This means that the IRS disregards the LLC's separate existence for tax purposes and it does not file a separate tax return, but the business's profits and losses are reported on the owner's personal tax return.

### BENEFITS/USE CASES:

<b>Scaling Limited Liability Protections:</b>

Just as an example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be joint and severely liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory a DAO without a legal entity creates a General Partnership and the members are all considered General Partners of the same.2 This particular case involved an alleged $50M exploit of a DeFi exchange where the plaintiffs sued the DAO and members of the DAO (as unknown John Does).
As evidenced by this specific case, not all DAOs, tokens, NFTs, or projects in web3 are going to create a legal entity the way ENS DAO did for the benefit of its members, but nothing stops people from proactively creating their own legal entities for the purposes of providing them the same limited liability protections.

RR-BAYC is an example of a project that did not use a legal entity to protect the people involved. Whatever your opinion about the case or the parties, the defendants were sued by Yuga Labs individually for approximately $2M in profits from alleged trademark infringement. Yuga ended up with a judgement that exceeded the alleged revenues by $7M, because there was no legal entity protecting them, Yuga can pursue that $7M deficiency against the defendants personally, where an LLC might have limited their liability and protected their personal assets.

<b>Bridge IRL Businesses Onchain:</b>

Businesses are more acutely aware of legal and regulatory considerations of accepting cryptocurrency and owning self-custodied digital assets. TOKENIZATION LLC can provide any real world business a seperate LLC, as a wholly owned subsidary, integrated into ENS to create limited liability protections between the legal entity operating in the real world and the business operations onchain using the ENS. 

<b>Legal Personhood and Right to Contract:</b>

Assume you own a NFT with commercial IP rights. A legal entity gives you a legal vehicle to own the NFT and enter into a real world legal agreements, such as a licensing agreement, of behalf of the NFT. The LLC protects the owner and the owners personal assets from potential liabilities of the licensing agreement.

<b>RWA Tokenization Abstraction:</b>

There are legal and regulatory issues preventing tokenization of certain real world assets. For example, a property owner would not generally be able to tokenize and transfer their property onchain in the US.  The US is a patchwork of laws with 50 states and thousands of counties that nearly all have their own rules regarding memorializing transfers of property by recording a public deed. While the direct ownership of property generally cannot be tokenized directly, an LLC can be created to own the property, recorded on a deed, and then the LLC ownership can be tokenized and transfered onchain without triggering a change in legal title of the property.  

### BUDGET/MILESTONES:

Using the $500 1st place prize from the Webhash Buildathon as an inital budget for my project todate I have completed the following:

* TOKENIZATION LLC Certificate of Formation, State of Delaware Filing Fee): $210 (I paid $100 expedite fee)
* Delaware Registered Agent: $50/year
* Delaware Trademark Fees: $35
* US Provisional Patent Filing Fee: $60
* Mystery Expense: ~$79 
* ENS Cost: ~$60

Remaining Balance: $35
