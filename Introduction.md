### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC SOLVING?

It is easy to create a corporation, limited liability company, trust, or even a Cayman Island Foundation (like the ENS Foundation that wraps ENS DAO), but because of costs and a lack of access to professionals (such as lawyers and accountants), historically the law has difficult to scale.

This failure of law to adapt to emerging technology and scale has created unmitigated legal risks and potential liabilities for anyone and everyone using self-custody wallets for all of their onchain activities. 

Tokenization LLC applies web3 ethos, and web3 public goods infrastructure (ENS), to the law and solves these problems by democratizing access to the law and *abstracting away* the fees and costs.

As an example, TOKENIZATION LLC, is a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company and was required by law to file a Certificate of Formation, appoint a registered agent, and paying associated costs.  Further, every year thereafter Tokenization LLC will be required to pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.  For a lawyer like me, this still results in hundreds of dollars in legal fees, but for most people it might require the additional cost of thousands of dollars for professional services of lawyers.

TOKENIZATION LLC uses ENS to abstract away filing fees, regitered agent appointments, and franchise taxes.  Moreover, as a Delaware Series LLC any number of protected series can be formed under TOKENIZATION LLC by minting an ENS name, subdomain or subname, each its own protected series that is can be treated as a seperate legal entity with unique ownership, management, assets, debts/liabilities from TOKENIZATION LLC and all series thereunder.   

### WHY HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY?

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Document:


<b>limited liability protections</b>

The general rationale for limited liability protections ENS DAO members is applicable to anyone and everyone transacting from a self-custody wallet that wants to take steps to legally protect their personal assets from their onchain activities, transactions and assets.  

For example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be jointly and serverly liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory a DAO without a legal entity creates a General Partnership and the members are all considered General Partners of the same.[^2]  This particular case involved an alleged $50M exploit of a DeFi exchange where the plaintiffs sued the DAO and members of the DAO (as unknown John Does).
