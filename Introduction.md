# TOKENIZATION LLC

A patent-pending[^1] system and method for minting, owning and managing a tokenized Delaware limited liability company integrated into ENS.

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC
([`tokenizationllc.eth.limo`]([https://enslikeprotocol.eth.limo](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)))

### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD ON ENS?

 As an example, TOKENIZATION LLC, is a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company and was required by law to file a Certificate of Formation, appoint a registered agent, and paying associated costs.  Further, every year thereafter Tokenization LLC will be required to pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.  For a lawyer like me, this still results in hundreds of dollars in legal fees, but for most people it might require the additional cost of thousands of dollars for professional services of lawyers.

TOKENIZATION LLC uses ENS to abstract away filing fees, regitered agent appointments, and franchise taxes.  Moreover, as a Delaware Series LLC any number of protected series can be formed under TOKENIZATION LLC by minting an ENS name, subdomain or subname, each its own protected series that is can be treated as a seperate legal entity with unique ownership, management, assets, debts/liabilities from TOKENIZATION LLC and all series thereunder.   

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC SOLVING?

It is easy to create a corporation, limited liability company, trust, or even a Cayman Island Foundation (like the ENS Foundation that wraps ENS DAO), but historically because of costs and a lack of access to professionals (such as lawyers and accountants) legal benefits of legal entities has difficult to scale.

This failure of law to adapt to emerging technology and scale has created unmitigated legal risks and potential liabilities for anyone and everyone using self-custody wallets for all of their onchain activities. 

Tokenization LLC applies web3 ethos, and web3 public goods infrastructure (ENS), to the law and solves these problems by democratizing access to the law and *abstracting away* the fees and costs.

### WHY HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY?

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Document:


<b>limited liability protections</b>

The rationale for limited liability protections for ENS DAO members is generally applicable to anyone and everyone transacting from a self-custody wallet that wants to take steps to legally protect their personal assets from their onchain activities, transactions and assets.  

Just as an example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be jointly and serverly liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory a DAO without a legal entity creates a General Partnership and the members are all considered General Partners of the same.[^2]  This particular case involved an alleged $50M exploit of a DeFi exchange where the plaintiffs sued the DAO and members of the DAO (as unknown John Does).

As evidenced by this specific case, not all DAOs, tokens, NFTs, or projects in web3 are going to create a legal entity the way ENS DAO did for the benefit of its members, but nothing stops people from proactively creating their own legal entities for the purposes of providing them the same limited liability protections.

<b>Legal Personhood and Right to Contract</b>

Whether you are a individual or a IRL business, lets assume you own a NFT with commercial IP rights. A legal entity allows the owner to enter a real world legal agreement, such as a licensing for the IP, using the legal entity instead of entering the legal agreement individually, protecting the owner and the owners personal assets from potential liabilities.  

<b>Bridge IRL Businesses Onchain</b>

Businesses are more acutely aware of legal and regulatory considerations of transacting online.  Can a business begin accepting crypotocurrency in exchange for goods/services?  How does a business take legal title and manage digital assets?  TOKENIZATION LLC provides the legal vehicle an existing IRL business can own that memorializes and codifies the business activites and assets onchain.  This also create an additional layer of limited liability protections between the existing IRL business and their onchain activities.  

<b>RWA Tokenization Abstraction</b>

Legally, not all real world assets can be tokenized directly and represented on chain.  For example, a property owner would not generally be able to tokenize and transfer their property onchain without recording a deed memorializing the transfer.  However, an LLC could take title to real world assets, such as real property, tokenized ownership of the LLC could be transfered onchain without triggering any need to record a deed in the real world, because the transfer of ownership has been abstracted away to the LLC.
