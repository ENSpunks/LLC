# TOKENIZATION LLC

A patent-pending[^1] system and method for minting, owning and managing a tokenized Delaware a limited liability company integrated into ENS.

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC 
([`tokenizationllc.eth.limo`]([https://enslikeprotocol.eth.limo](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)))

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC SOLVING?

It is easy to create a corporation, limited liability company, trust, or even a Cayman Island Foundation (like the ENS Foundation that wraps ENS DAO), but because of costs and a lack of access to professionals (such as lawyers and accountants), historically the law has difficult to scale.  This failure to scale has created unmitigated legal risks and potential liabilities for any and all self-custody wallets and onchain activities. 

Tokenization LLC applies web3 ethos, and web3 public goods infrastructure (ENS), to the law to and solves these problems by democratizing access to the law and abstracting away the fees and costs.

As an example, TOKENIZATION LLC, is a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company and was required by law to file a Certificate of Formation, appoint a registered agent, and paying associated costs.  Further, every year thereafter Tokenization LLC will be required to pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.  For a lawyer like me, this still results in hundreds of dollars in legal fees, but for most people it might require the additional cost of thousands of dollars for professional services of lawyers.

TOKENIZATION LLC  ENS to abstract away theses filings, registered agent and costs.  Moreover, any number of protected series can be formed under TOKENIZATION LLC by minting an ENS name, subdomain or subname, each protected series being a seperate legal entity with unique ownership, management, assets, debts/liabilities.   

### Why have a legal entity?

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Document:


The general rationale for limited liability protections is applicable to anyone and everyone transacting transacting from a self-custody wallet that wants to take steps to legally protect their personal assets from their onchain activities and assets.  

For example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be jointly and serverly liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory a DAO without a legal entity creates a General Partnership and the members are all considered General Partners of the same.[^2]  This particular case involved an alleged $50M exploit of a DeFi exchange where the plaintiffs sued the DAO and members of the DAO (as unknown John Does).   

### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD ON ENS?

An opensource for liking content across the web using gasless ENS records.  
More generally, ELP will organize ENS records, and make records accessible 
and useful for users and developers.

Prior to ELP, ENSpunks launched LikeButton.eth as a way for ENS users to give other ENS users ❤️ onchain representing "decentralized likes." $❤️ was popular with both the ENS community and developers in the ENS ecosystem.  For example, a developer from the ENS community created a chrome extension for giving ❤️ on Twitter and eth.photos integrated ❤️ into their ENS profile pages.  However, network fees hurt widespread adoption and likebutton.eth otherwise operated as a public good but failed to obtain public goods funding. 

ELP takes the lessons learned from likebutton.eth and will rebuild as a tokenless, gasless and permissionless protocol native to ENS using gasless IPFS+CCIP-Read+ENS Records (ICE).  Between using gasless ENS records and focusing on organizing ENS records, and making records accessible and useful, ELP hopes to help ENS protocol scale to 1 millions users with unique text records set. 

| ENS Record Managers      | Gas Free Records | IPFS+CCIP+ENS Record (ICE) DApps      | ENS Record profile/Gateway|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |

#### Specs 

- **`❤️ Subdomain & ELP Gasless Resolver`:** 
   
   Users will mint a ❤️ subdomain on their own ENS name (Ex.: ❤️.enspunks.eth).  The easiest method is the UI at enslikeprotocol.eth.limo to create a subdomain where the ELP resolver for gasless ❤️ records will be set automatically.  Users can also mint the ❤️ subdomain on ENS.domains and manually change the ENS subdomain resolver to resolver.enslikeprotocol.eth.  

- **`Creating ENS ❤️ Records` :**  

   Users can manage (create and delete) gasless ❤️ ENS records [❤️: content link]  on a user friendly UI at ❤️.<user>.eth.limo. 

- **`Organizing ❤️ Records and Making Them Accessible and Useable` :**

  ELP will organize the ❤️ ENS records, and make the accessible and useable for users and developers. For example, users can view and manage ❤️ ENS records through the user-friendly UI.  Moreover, ELP will be open and interoperable with other protocols such as Ethereum Follow Protcol (EFP).
