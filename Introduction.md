# TOKENIZATION LLC - Mint/Own/Manage a Delaware LLC on ENS

##

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC
</br>
[`tokenizationllc.eth`](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)

### BACKGROUND

I have been a practicing attorney since 2010. The majority of my career I have acted as outside counsel for business organizations. My practice included governance, compliance, intellectual property protection, tax strategy, mergers & acquisitions, or other business transactions.

In 2022 I launched an ENS project with a group of 4 that I had never met IRL. One claimed to be an attorney from the US (me); one claimed to be an astrophysicist+mathematician in another Country; one that claimed to be an Australian photographer and surfer; and the last was totally undoxxed, but rumors abound of a Sherpa somewhere in the mountains. I proposed a legal entity to cover us all, like the ENS Foundation, for purposes of protecting us and potential users, but due to the situation a legal entity was a non-starter for the group. That is when I initially drafted the legal documentation for PUNKS LLC, a Delaware Series LLC, that forms the foundation of TOKENIZATION LLC, and began "wrapping" my individual wallets for limited liability protections starting with my gnosis safe multisig wallet for the project (memorialized in my PUNKS LLC documentation as an enspunks.eth subdomain).

TOKENIZATION LLC is an attempt to patent the system and method1 and scale this legal and technological solution I built for myself with PUNKS LLC.

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC? 

TOKENIZATION LLC, is a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company

A Series LLC, short for Series Limited Liability Company, is a unique legal structure that is oddly a lot like ENS Names. Where the ENS can create any number of subdomains, each with its own owner, manager, addresses, assets and records, the Series LLC can create any number of series, or seperate LLCs, each with its own owner, manager, accounts, assets, records, and limited liability protections. Further, where ENS has an owner and manager and the owner can change the manager, each series has a owner (called member) and manager, similarly the series owner can "set" the manager. Also where ENS names can be wrapped or unwrapped, a Delaware Series LLC series can be registered or protected.

The LLC Oracle, describe below, is similar to DNSSEC for gasless DNS import into ENS. Mostly invisible infrastructure that when enabled provides an independent source of truth or verification, or in the case of LLCs "proof of legal personhood".

### üîÆ LLC ORACLE

The LLC Oracle is a legal framework that legally binds protected series under TOKENIZATION LLC to ENS names, subdomains, and subnames.

The initial LLC Oracle is currently made up of the following legal documentation:

üìú TOKENIZATION LLC Delaware Certificate of Formation (Filed)

üìÑ TOKENIZATION LLC Operating Agreement (Drafted, unpublished)

üìù [subdomain].tokenizationllc.eth Protected Series Operating Agreement (Drafted, unpublished)

‚öñÔ∏è Delaware LLC Act

### WHY HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY?

The rationale for limited liability protections for ENS DAO members is generally applicable to all web3 users, or anyone generally with one or more self-custody wallets that desires to take steps to legally protect their personal assets from onchain activities, assets and/or transactions.

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Document:


### TAXATION

Under the initial LLC Oracle, the ENS owner is the 100% owner of the TOKENIZATION LLC series, making each series a "single-member" LLC. For tax purposes, the IRS treats a single-member LLC as a "disregarded entity" by default. This means that the IRS disregards the LLC's separate existence for tax purposes and it does not file a separate tax return, but the business's profits and losses are reported on the owner's personal tax return the same as they would have done without have the legal protections offered by the LLC.

### BENEFITS/USE CASES:

<b>Scaling Limited Liability Protections:</b>

Just as an example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be joint and severely liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory a DAO without a legal entity creates a General Partnership and the members are all considered General Partners of the same.2 This particular case involved an alleged $50M exploit of a DeFi exchange where the plaintiffs sued the DAO and members of the DAO (as unknown John Does).
As evidenced by this specific case, not all DAOs, tokens, NFTs, or projects in web3 are going to create a legal entity the way ENS DAO did for the benefit of its members, but nothing stops people from proactively creating their own legal entities for the purposes of providing them the same limited liability protections.

RR-BAYC is an example of a project that did not use a legal entity to protect the people involved. Whatever your opinion about the case or the parties, the defendants were sued by Yuga Labs individually for approximately $2M in profits from alleged trademark infringement. Yuga ended up with a judgement that exceeded the alleged revenues by $7M, because there was no legal entity protecting them, Yuga can pursue that $7M deficiency against the defendants personally, where an LLC might have limited their liability and protected their personal assets.

<b>Bridge IRL Businesses Onchain:</b>

Businesses are more acutely aware of legal and regulatory considerations of transacting online. Can a business begin accepting cryptocurrency in exchange for goods/services? How does a business take legal title and manage digital assets? TOKENIZATION LLC provides the legal vehicle an existing IRL business can own that memorializes and codifies the business activities and assets onchain. This also creates an additional layer of limited liability protections between the existing IRL business and their onchain activities. 

<b>Legal Personhood and Right to Contract:</b>

Assume you own a NFT with commercial IP rights. A legal entity gives you a legal vehicle to own the NFT and enter into a real world legal agreements, such as a licensing agreement, of behalf of the NFT. The LLC protects the owner and the owners personal assets from potential liabilities of the licensing agreement.

<b>RWA Tokenization Abstraction:</b>

There are legal and regulatory issues preventing tokenization of certain real world assets. For example, a property owner would not generally be able to tokenize and transfer their property onchain in the US.  The US is a patchwork of laws with 50 states and thousands of counties that nearly all have their own rules regarding memorializing transfers of property by recording a public deed. While the direct ownership of property generally cannot be tokenized directly, an LLC can be created to own the property, recorded on a deed, and then the LLC ownership can be tokenized and transfered onchain without triggering a change in legal title of the property.  

### BUDGET/MILESTONES:

Using the $500 1st place prize from the Webhash Buildathon as an inital budget for my project todate I have completed the following:

* TOKENIZATION LLC Certificate of Formation, State of Delaware Filing Fee): $210 (I paid $100 expedite fee)
* Delaware Registered Agent: $50/year
* Delaware Trademark Fees: $35
* US Provisional Patent Filing Fee: $60
* Mystery Expense: ~$79 
* ENS Cost: ~$60

Remaining Balance: $35
