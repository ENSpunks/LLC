# TOKENIZATION LLC

A patent-pending[^1] system and method for minting, owning and managing a tokenized Delaware a limited liability company using ENS.

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC 
([`tokenizationllc.eth.limo`]([https://enslikeprotocol.eth.limo](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)))

### POINT OF CONTACT:

`enspunks.eth` 

### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD ON ENS?

An opensource for liking content across the web using gasless ENS records.  More generally, ELP will organize ENS records, and make records accessible and useful for users and developers.

Prior to ELP, ENSpunks launched LikeButton.eth as a way for ENS users to give other ENS users ❤️ onchain representing "decentralized likes." $❤️ was popular with both the ENS community and developers in the ENS ecosystem.  For example, a developer from the ENS community created a chrome extension for giving ❤️ on Twitter and eth.photos integrated ❤️ into their ENS profile pages.  However, network fees hurt widespread adoption and likebutton.eth otherwise operated as a public good but failed to obtain public goods funding. 

ELP takes the lessons learned from likebutton.eth and will rebuild as a tokenless, gasless and permissionless protocol native to ENS using gasless IPFS+CCIP-Read+ENS Records (ICE).  Between using gasless ENS records and focusing on organizing ENS records, and making records accessible and useful, ELP hopes to help ENS protocol scale to 1 millions users with unique text records set.

#### Specs 

- **`❤️ Subdomain & ELP Gasless Resolver`:** 
   
   Users will mint a ❤️ subdomain on their own ENS name (Ex.: ❤️.enspunks.eth).  The easiest method is the UI at enslikeprotocol.eth.limo to create a subdomain where the ELP resolver for gasless ❤️ records will be set automatically.  Users can also mint the ❤️ subdomain on ENS.domains and manually change the ENS subdomain resolver to resolver.enslikeprotocol.eth.  

- **`Creating ENS ❤️ Records` :**  

   Users can manage (create and delete) gasless ❤️ ENS records [❤️: content link]  on a user friendly UI at ❤️.<user>.eth.limo. 

- **`Organizing ❤️ Records and Making Them Accessible and Useable` :**

  ELP will organize the ❤️ ENS records, and make the accessible and useable for users and developers. For example, users can view and manage ❤️ ENS records through the user-friendly UI.  Moreover, ELP will be open and interoperable with other protocols such as Ethereum Follow Protcol (EFP).  

### PAST EXPERIENCE WORKING ON ENS
ENSpunks.eth has been building in the ENS ecosystem for several years, projects ENSpunks worked on include:

#### `BoredENSYachtClub.eth`
[BoredENSYachtClub.eth](https://BoredENSYachtClub.eth.limo) is an pre-namewrapper ENS subdomain collection built with IPFS, CCIP-Read and ENS Wild Card Resolution.  Almost 1,000 subdomains were minted creating a ENS community sub-DAO where members discuss ENS DAO Small Grants, and vote their subdomains on snapshot collectively voting the community $ENS in the ENS DAO. 

#### `LikeButton.eth`
[LikeButton.eth](https://likebutton.eth.limo)  the first experiment with a "decentralized like button" for the ENS community built with $❤️.

#### `Searchd.eth`
[Searchd.eth](https://searchd.eth.limo), fromerly [Geocities.eth](https://geocities.eth.limo), a .eth website search engine and general resource for ENS users.

### SIZE OF TEAM AND COMMITMENT
- Pending funding, there will be 1 full-time member of the team (`enspunks.eth`), a part-time social media/community manager, and contract workers when required for front-end development and integrations.
