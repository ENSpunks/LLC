# TOKENIZATION LLC - Mint/Own/Manage a Delaware LLC on ENS

##

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC
</br>
[`tokenizationllc.eth`](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)

### BACKGROUND

I became an attorney in 2010.  The majority of my career I have acted as outside counsel for business organizations.  My practice included governance, compliance, intellectual property protection, tax strategy, mergers & acquisitions, or other business transactions.

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC? 

TOKENIZATION LLC, is a Delaware *Series* Limited Liability Company 

### WHAT IS A SERIES LLC? 

A Series LLC, short for Series Limited Liability Company, is a unique legal structure that allows for the creation of individual series within a single LLC entity. Historically, Series LLCs were used by property owners or as asset holding companies, generally they operate as a separate entity with its own assets, liabilities, members (owners), managers and business activities.

### üîÆ LLC Oracle

üìú Delaware Certificate of Formation (Filed)

üìÑ LLC Operating Agreement (Drafted, Unpublished)

üìù Protected Series Operating Agreement (Drafted, Unpublished)

‚öñÔ∏è Delaware LLC Act

At a high level the LLC Oracle "abstracts away" the lawyers, drafting of legal documentation, filing fees, registered agent fees and annual franchise taxes. 

The LLC Oracle is a legalframe that legally binds protected series under TOKENIZATION LLC to ENS names, subdomains, and subnames.   

### WHY HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY?

The rationale for limited liability protections for ENS DAO members is generally applicable to all web3 uses, or anyone generally with one or more self-custody wallets that desires to take steps to legally protect their personal assets from onchain activities, assets and/or transactions.  

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Document:


### BENEFITS/USE CASES:

<b>Scaling Limited Liability Protections:</b>

Just as an example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be jointly and serverly liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory a DAO without a legal entity creates a General Partnership and the members are all considered General Partners of the same.[^2]  This particular case involved an alleged $50M exploit of a DeFi exchange where the plaintiffs sued the DAO and members of the DAO (as unknown John Does).

As evidenced by this specific case, not all DAOs, tokens, NFTs, or projects in web3 are going to create a legal entity the way ENS DAO did for the benefit of its members, but nothing stops people from proactively creating their own legal entities for the purposes of providing them the same limited liability protections.

<b>Legal Personhood and Right to Contract:</b>

Assume you own a NFT with commercial IP rights. A legal entity gives you a legal vehicle to own the NFT and enter into a real world legal agreements, such as a licensing agreement, of behalf of the NFT.  The LLC protects the owner and the owners personal assets from potential liabilities of the licensing agreement.  

<b>Bridge IRL Businesses Onchain:</b>

Businesses are more acutely aware of legal and regulatory considerations of transacting online.  Can a business begin accepting crypotocurrency in exchange for goods/services?  How does a business take legal title and manage digital assets?  TOKENIZATION LLC provides the legal vehicle an existing IRL business can own that memorializes and codifies the business activites and assets onchain.  This also create an additional layer of limited liability protections between the existing IRL business and their onchain activities.  

<b>RWA Tokenization Abstraction:</b>

Legally, not all real world assets can be tokenized directly and represented on chain.  For example, a property owner would not generally be able to tokenize and transfer their property onchain without recording a deed memorializing the transfer.  However, an LLC could take title to real world assets, such as real property, tokenized ownership of the LLC could be transfered onchain without triggering any need to record a deed in the real world, because the transfer of ownership has been abstracted away to the LLC.

<b>RR BAYC:</b>

RR-BAYC is an example of a project that did not use a legal entity to protect the people involved.  They got sued by Yuga Labs individually for approximately $2M in profits from alleged trademark infringment, but the value of the judgement exceeded alleged revenues by $7M including attorneys fees and costs.

### Budget/Milestones:

Using the $500 1st place prize from the Webhash Buildathon as an inital budget for my project I completed the following:

* TOKENIZATION LLC Certificate of Formation, State of Delaware Filing Fee): $210 (I paid $100 expedite fee)
* Delaware Registered Agent: $50/year
* Delaware Trademark Fees: $35
* US Prosivional Patent Filing Fee: $60
* Mystery Cost: ~$79 (I'll never tell)
* ENS Cost: ?

Remaining Balance: $95 

Not reflected in those costs are my education and years of professional practice.  However, in at least one instance, illustrated above, a subdomain from TOKENIZATION LLC under the LLC Oracle could have protected at least two individuals from a $7M surplus judgment.
