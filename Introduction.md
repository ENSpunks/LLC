# TOKENIZATION LLC - Mint a Delaware LLC

##

### NAME AND WEBSITE:

TOKENIZATION LLC
</br>
[`tokenizationllc.eth`](https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization)

### BACKGROUND

I became an attorney in 2010.  The majority of my career has been as outside counsel for business organizations, typically handling matters like governance, compliance, intellectual property protection, tax strategy, mergers & acquisitions, or other business transactions.

In 2019, I became the first attorney to deploy an ERC-20 contract and memorialize the address of the same in a Certificate of Formation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State.

In 2021, I filed a US trademark application using an ENS as the "specimen," successfully registered in 2022.  I've since used the Trademark to get the @geocities handles from platforms including Meta (Instagram & Threads), TiKTok, and even the secure the release of the geocities domains from UD for $200 down from $100K+ :).   

In 2022, I was part of a project with 3 other people on ENS I had never met IRL.  One claims to be a lawyer in the US (Me), one that claims to be an astrophysicist+mathematician, one that claims to be a Austalian photographer, surfer and artist, and last but not least an undoxxable Sherpa.  

My solution was to form PUNKS LLC, a Delaware series limited liability company.  At the time, I used a protected series to codify, or "wrap", enspunks.eth subdomains using protected series operating agreements.  Initially I wrapped a single subdomain for use a a signatory on the projects multisig.  Then, I wrote a script to automatically generate the legal agreements for my wallets.  

### Budget/Milestones:

Using the $500 1st place prize from the Webhash Buildathon as an inital budget for my project I spent the following:

TOKENIZATION LLC Certificate of Formation, State of Delaware Filing Fee): $210 (I paid $100 expedite fee)
Delaware Registered Agent: $50/year
Delaware Trademark Fees: $35
US Prosivional Patent Filing Fee: $60
Mystery Cost: ~$79 (I'll never tell)
ENS Cost: ?

Remaining Balance: $95 

Not reflected in those costs are my education and years of professional practice, but I can 

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC? 

TOKENIZATION LLC, is a Delaware *Series* Limited Liability Company 

### WHAT IS A SERIES LLC? 

A Series LLC, short for Series Limited Liability Company, is a unique legal structure that allows for the creation of individual series within a single LLC entity. Historically, Series LLCs were used by property owners or as asset holding companies, generally they operate as a separate entity with its own assets, liabilities, members (owners), managers and business activities.

### üîÆ LLC Oracle

At a high level the LLC Oracle is the legalframe abd technical framework that "binds" ENS names, subdomains and subnames to indepented protected series under TOKENIZATION LLC.

TOKENIZATION LLCs will initially start with a single Protected Series Operating Agreement for a subdomains on a specific ENS name (to be disclosed in the Protected Series Operating Agreement).

### WHY HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY?

The rationale for limited liability protections for ENS DAO members is generally applicable to all web3 uses, or anyone generally with one or more self-custody wallets that desires to take steps to legally protect their personal assets from onchain activities, assets and/or transactions.  

The following is an excerpt from the ENS DAO Governance Document:



### BENEFITS/USE CASES:

<b>Scaling Limited Liability Protections:</b>

Just as an example, a Federal Court in California recently ruled the members of a DAO may be jointly and serverly liable for the damages of the DAO under the theory a DAO without a legal entity creates a General Partnership and the members are all considered General Partners of the same.[^2]  This particular case involved an alleged $50M exploit of a DeFi exchange where the plaintiffs sued the DAO and members of the DAO (as unknown John Does).

As evidenced by this specific case, not all DAOs, tokens, NFTs, or projects in web3 are going to create a legal entity the way ENS DAO did for the benefit of its members, but nothing stops people from proactively creating their own legal entities for the purposes of providing them the same limited liability protections.

<b>Legal Personhood and Right to Contract:</b>

Whether you are a individual or a IRL business, lets assume you own a NFT with commercial IP rights. A legal entity allows the owner to enter a real world legal agreement, such as a licensing for the IP, using the legal entity instead of entering the legal agreement individually, protecting the owner and the owners personal assets from potential liabilities.  

<b>Bridge IRL Businesses Onchain:</b>

Businesses are more acutely aware of legal and regulatory considerations of transacting online.  Can a business begin accepting crypotocurrency in exchange for goods/services?  How does a business take legal title and manage digital assets?  TOKENIZATION LLC provides the legal vehicle an existing IRL business can own that memorializes and codifies the business activites and assets onchain.  This also create an additional layer of limited liability protections between the existing IRL business and their onchain activities.  

<b>RWA Tokenization Abstraction:</b>

Legally, not all real world assets can be tokenized directly and represented on chain.  For example, a property owner would not generally be able to tokenize and transfer their property onchain without recording a deed memorializing the transfer.  However, an LLC could take title to real world assets, such as real property, tokenized ownership of the LLC could be transfered onchain without triggering any need to record a deed in the real world, because the transfer of ownership has been abstracted away to the LLC.

<b>RR BAYC:</b>

RR-BAYC is an example of a project that did not use a legal entity to protect the people involved.  They got sued by Yuga Labs individually for approximately $2M in profits from trademark infringment, but the value of the the judgement exceeded alleged revenues by $7M including attorneys fees and costs.

### WHAT IS TOKENIZATION LLC SOLVING?

It is easy to create a corporation, limited liability company, trust, or even a Cayman Island Foundation (like the ENS Foundation that wraps ENS DAO), but historically because of costs and a lack of access to professionals (such as lawyers and accountants) legal benefits of legal entities has difficult to scale.

This failure of law to adapt to emerging technology and scale has created unmitigated legal risks and potential liabilities for anyone and everyone using self-custody wallets for all of their onchain activities. 

Tokenization LLC applies web3 ethos, and web3 public goods infrastructure (ENS), to the law and solves these problems by democratizing access to the law and *abstracting away* the fees and costs.
