# ENS Subdomains for Owning & Managing Limited Liability Companies ("LLCs") 

## Abstract

The project will create 10,000 "tokenized" LLCs, or Series, under a Delaware Series LLC. The ownership of each LLC/Series shall be represented by a corresponding ENS subdomain and tradable onchain. Each LLC/Series may have unique ownership and management, may own assets that are isolated from the other LLCs/Series, and provide limited liability protections to the owners from the other LLCs/Series.

## Background

In 2017, Delaware enacted amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (DLLCA), allowing corporations and LLCs to use electronic databases like blockchains for business records. This legislation sets the groundwork for greater security, reliability, transparency, and efficiency with smart contracts.  Specifically, the law anticipates onchain ownership.  

### Delaware Series LLC

This project shall utilize the Delaware Series LLC structure, specifically using "protected Series" which do not need to be filed, or recorded, with the State of Delaware, file Delaware annual reports, nor pay Delaware annual franchise taxes.

## ENS as Legal Title

Each LLC/Series shall created through the a written Series Operating Agreement which shall memorialize and codify the ownership of each Series/LLC as a unique ENS subdomain.  Therefore, legal title of each LLC/Series shall be managed onchain as an ENS subdomain providing a unique and immutable identifier for ownership and management purposes.

## Future

This project establishes a legal framework that may be open-sourced along with the legal documentation. 

This framework could be utilized in the future in combination with oracles like Chainlink using CCIP to take ownership of real-world assets (RWAs) and put legal title on-chain.  In practice this framework can provide the foundation for T-0 settlements as well as the base layer for codifying more complex transactions such as options and drag-along or tag-along rights.

## Disclaimer/Disclosure

Each series is created with the express purposes of conducting any and all legal activities.  However, for practical purposes each LLC/Series shall be contractually prohibited from obtaining an EIN from the IRS, opening business bank accounts, or having multiple owners simultaneously. Effectively, each LLC/Series may be considered a holding company for digital onchain assets, providing owners limited liability protections.

As a single-member LLC, each Series is treated by the IRS as a disregarded entity for tax purposes. This means the LLCs/Series generally do not need to file a seperste tax return and income or losses are reported on Form Schedule-C of the owner's personal tax returns.

These disclosures and disclaimers are not legal or tax advice but are provided for informational purposes only. Each owner of a series should consult with a licensed attorney and tax professional.
