# ENS Subdomains for Owning & Managing Limited Liability Companies ("LLCs") 

## Abstract

The project will create 10,000 "tokenized" LLCs under a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company. Each series shall be uniquely represented by a corresponding ENS subdomain and tradable on-chain. Each series may have unique ownership and management, and own assets that are isolated from other LLCs.

## Background

In 2017, Delaware enacted amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (DLLCA), allowing corporations and LLCs to use electronic databases like blockchains for business records. This legislation sets the groundwork for greater security, reliability, transparency, and efficiency with smart contracts.

### Series LLC Legal Structure

The project utilizes the "protected" Delaware Series LLC structure, which does not need to be filed with the state of Delaware, file final Delaware annual reports, or pay Delaware franchise taxes.

## ENS as Legal Title

ENS subdomains are used as the on-chain legal title of each series, providing a unique and immutable identifier for ownership and management purposes.

## Future

This project establishes a legal framework that may be open-sourced along with the legal documentation. The framework could be utilized in the future in combination with oracles like Chainlink using CCIP to take ownership of real-world assets (RWAs) and put legal title on-chain.

## Disclaimer/Disclosure

Each series is created with the authority to conduct legal activities but is contractually prohibited from obtaining an EIN from the IRS, opening business bank accounts, or having multiple owners simultaneously. Each series acts as a holding company for digital on-chain assets, providing limited liability protections but not conducting business.

As a single-member LLC, each series is treated by the IRS as a disregarded entity for tax purposes. Income or losses are reported on Form Schedule-C of the owner's tax returns.

These disclosures and disclaimers are not legal or tax advice but are provided for informational purposes only. Each owner of a series should consult with a licensed attorney and tax professional.
